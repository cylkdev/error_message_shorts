## Introduction

Effective error handling reduces complexity and improves
security. By minimizing variation in error messages and
avoiding the leakage of sensitive information, you make
your application more predictable and secure. Consistent
error messages also simplify the user experience and
reduce the need for extensive documentation.

This API standardizes error message formatting to
maintain consistency and control over what is exposed to
users. It normalizes error messages in a predictable,
flexible, and testable manner.

This API represents error messages as a map with three
fields:

  * `:code` - The HTTP code, represented as an atom.
  * `:message` - The error message, as a string.
  * `:details` - Additional details, either nil or a map.

Normalizing these fields ensures only relevant, controlled
error information is sent to clients.

The API works by matching terms with parameters that
describe the comparison operation and value to compare.
If a match is found, the API replaces the term with a
predefined value or a callback function's return value.

Letâ€™s look at an example. Consider a function that returns
error messages with various HTTP codes:

  * `:bad_request`
  * `:request_timeout`
  * `:service_unavailable`
  * `:internal_server_error`

Handling all these codes separately can complicate the
user experience and documentation. Instead, group similar
errors into a broader category like `:internal_server_error`.
This reduces complexity and limits exposed information by
focusing on one general error code.

The same normalization applies to message and details
fields. By defining parameters and replacement values,
you ensure these fields are transformed consistently,
enhancing both security and clarity.
